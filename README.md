# Pac-Man
This project is a basic rendition of Pac-Man that uses the sound and graphics libraries from openFrameworks. Using the WASD keys to move up, left, down, and right respectively, the player must navigate the map to collect as many dots as possible (worth one point each) while avoiding the four ghosts. The player starts with three lives and if the player clears the entire board of dots before losing all three lives, a "refresh" power-up will pop up on the board, allowing him or her to pick it up and respawn all of the dots on the board.

To build and run this game:
- download project
- cd into project directory
- "make"
