# Project Proposal

I plan on making Pac-Man for my final project, using the graphics library. If I have time, I might also try to include the sound library for additional sound effects such as eating, dying, starting the game, and getting a one-up. The game will take in keyboard commands ('WASD' to move up, left, down, and right respectively, 'B' to begin, etc.) and will check for object collision upon each unit movement in any direction every update. The game will track relevant statistics, such as the highest score, and number of lives and will update during and after each game. I will need to import images from the game by either finding them online or making my own. In addition to making the original game, I will try to add something new to the game, such as new power-ups and unique music, sound effects, and visuals to go with each one of them.
