# Project Proposal

I plan on making Pac-Man for my final project, using the application, events, and graphics libraries. If I have time, I might also try to include the sound library for additional sound effects. The game will take in both mouse and keyboard commands (arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right, for example) and will check for object collision upon each unit movement in any direction.
