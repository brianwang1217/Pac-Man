# Project Proposal

I plan on making Pac-Man for my final project, using the application, events, and graphics libraries. If I have time, I might also try to include the sound library for additional sound effects. The game will take in both mouse and keyboard commands (arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right, for example) and will check for object collision upon each unit movement in any direction. The game will track relevant statistics, such as the number of ghosts killed, highest scores, and longest game times and will update its respective scoreboards after each game. I will need to import images from the game by either finding them online or making my own. In addition to making the original game, I will try to add something new to the game, such as new power-ups and unique music and visuals to go with each one of them.
